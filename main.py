            What does it meas the fee (copertura spese) mentioned on point 6 of the contract? the cost is only linked to the actual cost of creating the NFT which is €12+VAT, to be paid only after one year and only if the NFT has not been sold.
            
            How do you quantify our "doing the work"? Is it by checking for link hits or by the number of social shares/posts? We provide a tracking link and QR code tied to the NFT link, which is personalized for each artist, so using that link we can actually track (only browser, country, city and operating system) everyone who clicks on that link.

            During the year, do we also have to guarantee our presence at any video calls regarding the progress of the NFT or as a presentation of the artist and the work in collaboration with the Michele Cea foundation? Virtual presence is not mandatory, but a more in-depth analysis will be done when the NFTs are sold.

            Is it possible to choose another work or will the one from the competition be used? The work is at the discretion of the artist, it does not necessarily have to be from the competition, although it is advisable as they will be catalogued in the collection of that competition (in fact for other works, artists usually rely on us to create a dedicated collection for the artist).

            How long will it be possible to exhibit the NFT work with this project? Il vantaggio degli NFT, è che una volta creata l'opera, questa rimarrà in vetrina per sempre, anche se venisse venduto o ceduto il relativo NFT, infatti grazie alla tracciabilità in blockchain, si possono seguire tutti i passaggi dalla creazione fino al possessore attuale.

            Will we be able to proceed independently in this field for other exhibitions of digital works? the works digitized in NFT will be carried out by our startup (in this specific case the number of NFTs is 1 per artist), where we will effectively manage it forever by our team that will follow all the technical updates that naturally occur on the blockchain; then usually the artists rely on us to create the single artist page (i.e. the showcase), and also the collection, and in that case it follows the standard path (€12+VAT for a single NFT) and includes:
creating the artist/project page, example https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/eos-mainnet/quadrigossip
creating the collection, example https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/eos-mainnet/quadrigossip/scapicchifra
press release both ITA and ENG on the partnership with the artist, example https://medium.com/@hokentechitalia/juan-tardivo-sceglie-hoken-tech-ed-eos-per-la-sua-prima-collezione-nft-93da87777fb9
press release relating to the project, example https://medium.com/@hokentechitalia/la-collezione-ufficiale-nft-di-juan-tardivo-e93588baba7e
interview with the artist or with me or with the administrator Antonella, example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhThurNAAcI&list=PLbwtnTly-f3HLPhf7vSeejExN1_--Y-5c

            regarding the monetization issue, what advantages do NFTs offer? Can you find collectors interested in purchasing them more easily, for example? NFTs, being certificates that mathematically attest to the existence of the work, its origin, the artist and other information, allow them to be monetized directly, that is, it is the user who buys from the artist (the artist creates the work or whoever creates it, and immediately the work is accessible to everyone and can be viewed and bought by anyone in the world).

Another advantage is linked to its nature as a digital asset, acquiring various properties linked to the blockchain, for example:

- it can be exchanged with other NFTs
- it can be integrated into other media (for example NFT video games, in this case we have created several blockchain video games in which the player wins exclusive NFTs)
- contain unlockable content (for example an NFT of a book, can have the manuscript of the book as unlockable content)
- contain other crypto (for example in a competitive context, the winners are rewarded with exclusive NFTs that contain the cash prize)
- they survive over time, unlike traditional works of art, these NFTs that represent the works, will remain viewable and consultable forever
- historical archive, linked to the concept of before, thanks to NFTs you can have historical certainty (we are talking about orders of hundreds of years) on the works of an artist, identifying in an objective and mathematical way the original works and belonging to that artist
- renting the NFT, thanks to a particular smart contract, it is possible to rent your NFT to third parties in exchange for a fee
- obtain financing, by putting the relative NFT as a countervalue/collateral, the owner can obtain a loan based on the value of the NFT (like a pledge style)
- use it in corporate environments, for example our startup, also has an NFT as its share capital, demonstrating legal and economic value in this area
- be connected to physical goods, thanks to particular procedures (such as our tag), it is possible to associate the digital asset with the physical work, providing additional security
- be fused, there are particular smart contracts, which allow one or more NFTs to be merged, and from their fusion a new NFT is "born", a concept that has been and is used in some video games
- represent rights of various kinds, for example there are NFTs that do not represent a work of art, but a share of a company or a property, a sector that takes the name of Real World Asset (RWA), and in the case of properties, these are rented, and then the owners of the NFTs receive a share of the rent

            About a year and a half ago, I opened my own account on Metamask and at the moment there are €16 in Etherum. But then I didn't continue the path because I didn't have anyone to follow me and include me in a project and I had other priorities. I also published one of my works in NFT on the Foundation app, what I need to do? As for the NFT or NFTs you created, there are no problems, but they are incompatible with the EOS blockchain, and therefore to do things properly, you would have to "destroy" them and recreate them on EOS so as to have a harmony of the works and a coherence also with the main showcase, and I can also explain this to you calmly when we meet.

            Do I have to create a jiosign account to create OTP and therefore read the contract? Yes, it is used to have the mathematical security of the signature, so as not to create problems in the future.

            Price of the digital work only (separating it from the physical?) Right? Yes, the price, in dollars, of the digital work.

            If after a year the work is not sold, what happens? In economic terms? The artist then finds it on his account and has to liquidate it? Or did I misunderstand? The work continues to remain in the collection, you only have to pay €12+IVA, but it will then be managed by the artist, that's all.

            So, should the title of the work being considered be specified in the contract? It is not necessary to specify it also because it is one per artist and once the data has been acquired, it cannot be modified, so there is no risk of confusing subsequent works.

  Bitcoin in 2024: A Historic Year of Volatility and New Opportunities

The year 2024 proved to be a pivotal one for Bitcoin, marking a significant turning point in both price and global adoption. On one hand, the Bitcoin halving—one of the most anticipated events in the cryptocurrency calendar—served as a catalyst for major market movements. On the other hand, macroeconomic shifts, regulatory decisions, and rising interest from financial institutions transformed Bitcoin from an alternative asset to a global store of value.

But how did Bitcoin’s price perform throughout the year? Which events had the greatest impact? This article takes a historical look at 2024, analyzing dominant trends, key dates, and future prospects.

The Beginning of the Year: Momentum After the Crisis?

2024 began on an optimistic note: the global economic turbulence of 2023, including inflation and rising interest rates, seemed to finally be subsiding. Investor interest in Bitcoin re-emerged strongly, thanks to its established role as a safe-haven asset and hedge against inflation. The price of Bitcoin opened the year around $40,000, with signs of accumulation from institutional investors.

External Factors and the Macroeconomic Context

The year 2024 saw a slight easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and a decline in inflation in the United States. These factors renewed interest in riskier assets, including Bitcoin. Additionally, growing instability in the banking sector and uncertainty about the future of the global economy led many to view Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional currency systems.

Bitcoin as a "Safe Haven"

Bitcoin’s position in the market was solidified: it was no longer just a cryptocurrency but a decorrelated asset compared to traditional equities and sectors. This made Bitcoin particularly attractive to those seeking protection in times of economic uncertainty.

Key Events and Milestones of 2024

Several major events shaped Bitcoin’s price trajectory over the course of the year:

- January 2024: The SEC approved the first Spot Bitcoin ETFs, making it easier for institutional investors to access the market. This marked one of the biggest positive catalysts for Bitcoin.

- April 2024: The Bitcoin halving reduced miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, increasing Bitcoin’s scarcity and reinforcing its perceived value in the market.

- November 2024: Donald Trump’s re-election brought about a pro-Bitcoin stance, with promises of crypto-friendly regulations and incentives for Bitcoin miners operating in the United States.

- December 2024: On December 5, 2024, Bitcoin hit and surpassed the historic $100,000 mark for the first time.

Conclusion

The year 2024 represented a turning point for Bitcoin, cementing its path toward widespread global adoption. Thanks to key events like the halving and technological advancements, Bitcoin laid the groundwork to solidify its role as a global store of value. Looking ahead, Bitcoin seems poised not just to reach new all-time highs but also to redefine the boundaries of global finance. 

Blockchain and NFTs - The Complete Guide That Lawyers Must Read

New technologies are becoming a driving force in transforming traditional industries, and the legal sector is no exception. Among the most significant advancements of recent years are blockchain and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), two innovations that are starting to leave their mark on the operational mechanisms of the legal profession. But what exactly are they?

Blockchain is essentially a distributed digital ledger that guarantees security, transparency, and immutability of recorded data. NFTs, on the other hand, are a special form of digital token that represents a unique asset, often used to demonstrate authenticity and ownership of digital or physical items.

These technologies are not just innovative tools but actual game-changers for lawyers, law firms, and professionals specializing in technological compliance. The questions we must ask, then, are: how do blockchain and NFTs apply to the legal field? And what tangible benefits do they offer to legal professionals? Let’s explore these questions.

What Is Blockchain and Why It Matters for Law

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital system capable of recording transactions securely, transparently, and immutably. It is a "chain of blocks," where each block contains specific data cryptographically linked to the previous block. This structure eliminates the need for an intermediary to confirm or validate information.

Key Features:

- Transparency: All participants in the blockchain network have access to transaction records, which are public and verifiable.
- Immutability: Once recorded, data cannot be modified or removed, ensuring the integrity of information.
- Security: The cryptographic technology underlying blockchain protects data from unauthorized access.
- Traceability: Every action is permanently recorded, creating a complete and verifiable audit trail.

Practical Applications in Law:

- Smart Contracts: Digital agreements that execute automatically when pre-set conditions are met.
- Digital Notarization: The use of blockchain to certify the authenticity of documents and contracts.
- Secure Data Storage: Blockchain can securely store legal data, such as court rulings, corporate agreements, and property records.

Blockchain provides an ideal infrastructure to standardize legal processes and reduce errors, making many activities faster and more secure.

NFTs - What They Are and Their Applications in the Legal Sector

Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, are unique digital tokens registered on the blockchain that represent ownership or rights over a specific asset. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not fungible, meaning they cannot be exchanged at the same value because each NFT represents something unique.

Applications in Law:

- Proof of Ownership: NFTs can represent ownership of digital goods (digital artworks, logos, files) or physical assets (real estate, cars).
- Intellectual Property Management: Through NFTs, patent, trademark, and copyright holders can certify ownership and transfer licenses.
- Authentication of Legal Documents: NFTs can be used to register and verify the authenticity of contracts or agreements.
- Rights Transfer: NFTs allow for the fractionalization and transfer of rights for assets such as artworks, patents, or shared properties, with automated traceability.

The introduction of NFTs into the legal field represents a genuine innovation in the management and protection of digital ownership, offering unprecedented forms of safeguarding and transferring assets.

Advantages for the Legal Sector - Why Blockchain and NFTs Are Unique

The integration of blockchain and NFTs into the legal sector offers significant benefits for both individual professionals and large organizations.

Benefits of Blockchain:

- Efficiency: Automation of processes (like property transfers and contract execution) saves time and resources.
- Enhanced Security: Cryptographically-encrypted storage protects sensitive data from tampering and digital theft.
- Standardization: Blockchain tools are compatible with different jurisdictions, facilitating cross-border operations.

Benefits of NFTs:

- Faster Rights Transactions: Immediate certification and transfer of licenses and usage rights through NFTs.
- Innovation in Ownership Verification: Proofs of authenticity that can be adopted in legal disputes or due diligence processes.
- New Market Opportunities: Exploration of business models based on digital licenses and fractionalized assets.

Blockchain and NFTs are not products of technological hype; instead, they address real needs for security, traceability, and automation in the legal sector.

Case Studies and Concrete Applications

Here are some examples of how blockchain and NFTs are being utilized in the legal domain:

- Blockchain in Real Estate Transactions: In countries like the UAE, property registries built on blockchain enable ownership transfers without traditional notarization processes.
- Royalties Management Using NFTs: Artists and creators use programmable NFTs to automate royalty payments, ensuring transparency in distribution contracts.
- Digital Notarization: Platforms exist that use blockchain to quickly and securely certify digital contracts.
- Divisibility of Legal Assets: NFTs allow for the division of ownership of complex assets (e.g., exploitation rights for artworks) among multiple parties.

These examples demonstrate how technology is revolutionizing traditional processes.

Immediate Future Benefits - Opportunities for Lawyers and Law Firms

The introduction of blockchain and NFTs opens up new professional opportunities for lawyers and law firms:

- Specialization in Digital Law: Lawyers can become experts in smart contracts, blockchain compliance, and digital ownership.
- Development of New Services: Law firms can offer consulting services on issues related to NFTs and tokenizing assets.
- Automation of Procedures: Blockchain can be used for repetitive activities like notarization or document management.

The near future will see the emergence of hybrid legal professionals capable of combining technological expertise with legal knowledge.

Conclusion and Future Outlook

Blockchain and NFTs represent a milestone for the legal field, pushing lawyers and professionals toward a more automated, transparent, and secure future. Despite existing challenges, the prospects are exciting, promising to expand the boundaries of legal practice.

Continuous education and the adoption of these technologies will be key to staying competitive in an evolving market. This is not an option but a necessity to ensure that the legal sector leads, rather than chases, innovation.

EOS 2025: The Shocking Truth About Its Ultra-Low Energy Footprint
EOS 2025: The Shocking Truth About Its Ultra-Low Energy Footprint
Welcome to Hoken Tech.

In 2025, the EOS blockchain — originally built on a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus model — continues to be recognized for its high transaction throughput and low transaction fees. However, understanding the energy consumption behind EOS’s block producer infrastructure and overall network operation is paramount for stakeholders concerned with sustainability.

This report provides an in-depth technical analysis of EOS’s annual and per-transaction energy consumption, drawing upon established methodologies in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) research. Our goal is to deliver a clear picture of the underlying energy mechanics that power the EOS blockchain in 2025, offering sustainability insights crucial for developers, researchers, and investors alike.

https://youtu.be/oJPNi1ePQEE —


EOS and DPoS
EOS employs a Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in which a fixed number of elected block producers validate transactions. This reduces hardware competition, typically lowering energy consumption compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. While block producers are fewer in number, they often invest in sufficiently robust hardware — both for reliability and processing speed — thereby affecting overall energy use.

Prior Research
Various studies have examined PoS networks’ energy profiles, most notably the work by the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI). Methodologies from such analyses frequently involve measuring typical hardware setups via power monitoring devices, then extrapolating the resulting data across the entire network.

Methodology
To estimate energy consumption accurately, we assume each EOS block producer (BP) runs on hardware with the following baseline specifications:

• CPU: 4 cores at ≥ 3.8 GHz

• RAM: 64 GB

• SSD/HDD: 5120 GB of overall storage

• Network link: ≥ 100 Mb/s

These assumptions mirror mid-tier to high-performance machines in 2025, factoring in improvements over older benchmarks but remaining realistic for EOS’s throughput demands.

Power Draw Measurements
We adopt a measurement-based approach inspired by the CCRI white paper:

• Single Node Power, P_node (in watts).

• Daily or annual consumption computed by multiplying by time in hours.

• A separate step to calculate network-wide consumption by scaling single-node figures by the total number of block producers and additional nodes.

Our analysis focuses on three primary metrics:

(1) Single-node daily and annual energy consumption.

(2) Network-wide daily and annual energy consumption.

(3) Energy usage per transaction.

We define the following variables:

• P_node = average power draw of one node (in W).

• N_nodes = total number of EOS nodes actively participating (i.e., block producers + standby or validator-grade nodes).

• T_daily = daily transaction count.

• E_node_daily = daily energy consumption per node (kWh/day).

• E_network_daily = daily energy consumption for the entire network (kWh/day).

Calculation & Results
In this example scenario for 2025, we hypothesize that:

• P_node ≈ 100 W (based on hardware assumptions + observed load).

• N_nodes = 500 (a combination of main block producers, standby producers, and other significant network participants).

• T_daily = 2 × 10⁶ transactions/day (2 million daily transactions).

EOS Single-Node Daily Consumption
We calculate single-node daily consumption using:

(1) E_node_daily = (P_node × 24 h) / 1000

Substituting P_node = 100 W

E_node_daily = (100 W × 24 h) / 1000 = 2.4 kWh per day

EOS Single-Node Annual Consumption
(2) E_node_year = E_node_daily × 365

Hence:

E_node_year = 2.4 kWh/day × 365 ≈ 876 kWh per year

EOS Daily Network Consumption
(3) E_network_daily = E_node_daily × N_nodes

For N_nodes = 500, E_network_daily = 2.4 kWh/day × 500 = 1200 kWh per day for the entire EOS network

EOS Annual Network Consumption
(4) E_network_year = E_network_daily × 365

Thus:

E_network_year = 1200 kWh/day × 365 = 438,000 kWh per year

EOS Daily Per-Transaction Figure
We consider T_daily = 2,000,000 transactions/day.

(5) E_per_transaction_daily = E_network_daily / T_daily

Therefore:

E_per_transaction_daily = 1200 kWh/day ÷ 2,000,000 transactions/day = 0.0006 kWh/transaction = 0.6 Wh/transaction

EOS Annual Per-Transaction Figure
We first note that:

• Annual transactions T_year = T_daily × 365 = 730 million transactions.

(6) E_per_transaction_year = E_network_year / T_year

E_per_transaction_year = 438,000 kWh / 730,000,000 transactions ≈ 0.0006 kWh/transaction

This aligns perfectly with the daily calculation, given consistent daily rates.

Conclusions
In summary, the EOS blockchain in 2025 likely maintains a comparatively efficient energy profile, thanks to its Delegated Proof-of-Stake design and typical hardware usage among block producers. The calculations presented here offer a concise snapshot of how a 500-node EOS network might consume approximately 438,000 kWh annually, translating to an average of 0.6 Wh per transaction in a scenario with 2 million daily transactions.

EOS Rewind #4
EOS Rewind #4 — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech

As another year draws to a close, as usual, the startup Hoken Tech has prepared a recap of the events on the EOS blockchain over the past year, showcasing its dedication to keeping all users informed and serving as a reference point — especially for the Italian community.

January
03 — EOS Network Ventures (ENV), promoted by the EOS Network Foundation (ENF), invested $500,000 in the EZ Swap project.

04 — The release of Leap v5.0.0 introduced numerous improvements to the EOS blockchain and the corresponding EOS EVM, enhancing the speed of contract execution by 5x, reducing system memory usage by 20%, and more improvements available here.

10 — Another investment from ENV, this time in the NoahArk project DeFi initiative, amounting to over $2 million. This demonstrated their commitment to supporting key and important projects to drive the blockchain’s growth.

February
20 — On the development side, Leap is rebranded as Spring (Antelope Spring 1.0), introducing the new consensus algorithm called Savanna. This update delivers speeds 100x faster than the previous version and significantly reduces the finality time (finality is the time required for a block to become irreversible). Previously, it was about 120 seconds; this update reduces it to 0.5 seconds — scheduled for release at the end of July.

22 — Mercado Bitcoin announced the integration of the EOS cryptocurrency on its platform, enabling the Brazilian EOS community to buy and sell this asset.

27 — As we’ve come to expect in the blockchain world, criminals continue to target people and projects, siphoning off millions of dollars. However, they didn’t anticipate the Recover+ protocol on EOS, which allows participating projects to promptly intervene, freeze criminal accounts, and recover funds. For example, following an attack on Paycash, the protocol successfully recovered 2 million EOS, demonstrating the blockchain’s security against such threats.

28 — The Greymass team launches the Droplets system that allows you to manage NFTs through RAM, in fact these NFTs are supported by the RAM behind them, allowing you to create other solutions on the same, such as video games, and the first to use this system is Shipload

29 — DWF Labs, announces the launch of “Liquid Markets” an OTC compliance platform, where among the various tokens there is also EOS

March
06 — Improvements to the RAM system on the blockchain make resource management more efficient. It is now possible to transfer RAM between accounts, and this resource can now also be utilized in DeFi applications.

08 — Greymass officially launched Shipload.

27 — The exSat Network project was announced — a Bitcoin layer utilizing the EOS blockchain as its foundation, making the system faster, cheaper, and more secure for transferring Bitcoin. It also enables the creation of other applications, such as Bitcoin DeFi or Bitcoin-based videogames.

29 — The launch of ESCC (EOS Stable Coin Chain), a public blockchain based on EOS and the EOS EVM, specifically designed for stablecoins.

April
15 — New tokens and assets have emerged from RAM’s expansion on EOS, such as BRAM from DeFiBox, and more recently, WRAM, supported by EOS’s block producers.

28 — The EOS community began exploring ideas for a new tokenomics system for the blockchain. Discussions included reducing the inflation rate by 80%, enabling EOS to have a finite capped supply of 2.1 billion tokens.

May
01 — Hoken Tech published a guide on how to notarize documents using the EOS blockchain.

15 — The Cea Foundation reaffirmed Hoken Tech as its technical partner for the creation of NFTs for the Michele Cea award, all developed on the EOS blockchain.

Bitcoin in 2024: How $100K Became Reality & What’s Next for Crypto
Bitcoin in 2024: How $100K Became Reality & What’s Next for Crypto
Welcome to Hoken Tech

The year 2024 proved to be a pivotal one for Bitcoin, marking a significant turning point in both price and global adoption. On one hand, the Bitcoin halving — one of the most anticipated events in the cryptocurrency calendar — served as a catalyst for major market movements. On the other hand, macroeconomic shifts, regulatory decisions, and rising interest from financial institutions transformed Bitcoin from an alternative asset to a global store of value.

But how did Bitcoin’s price perform throughout the year? Which events had the greatest impact? This article takes a historical look at 2024, analyzing dominant trends, key dates, and future prospects.

https://youtu.be/PKC_IhperZ0 —


The Beginning of the Year: Momentum After the Crisis?
2024 began on an optimistic note: the global economic turbulence of 2023, including inflation and rising interest rates, seemed to finally be subsiding. Investor interest in Bitcoin re-emerged strongly, thanks to its established role as a safe-haven asset and hedge against inflation. The price of Bitcoin opened the year around $40,000, with signs of accumulation from institutional investors.

External Factors and the Macroeconomic Context
The year 2024 saw a slight easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and a decline in inflation in the United States. These factors renewed interest in riskier assets, including Bitcoin. Additionally, growing instability in the banking sector and uncertainty about the future of the global economy led many to view Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional currency systems.

Bitcoin as a “Safe Haven”
Bitcoin’s position in the market was solidified: it was no longer just a cryptocurrency but a decorrelated asset compared to traditional equities and sectors. This made Bitcoin particularly attractive to those seeking protection in times of economic uncertainty.

Key Events and Milestones of 2024
Several major events shaped Bitcoin’s price trajectory over the course of the year:

January 2024: The SEC approved the first Spot Bitcoin ETFs, making it easier for institutional investors to access the market. This marked one of the biggest positive catalysts for Bitcoin.
April 2024: The Bitcoin halving reduced miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, increasing Bitcoin’s scarcity and reinforcing its perceived value in the market.
November 2024: Donald Trump’s re-election brought about a pro-Bitcoin stance, with promises of crypto-friendly regulations and incentives for Bitcoin miners operating in the United States.
December 2024: On December 5, 2024, Bitcoin hit and surpassed the historic $100,000 mark for the first time.
Conclusion
The year 2024 represented a turning point for Bitcoin, cementing its path toward widespread global adoption. Thanks to key events like the halving and technological advancements, Bitcoin laid the groundwork to solidify its role as a global store of value. Looking ahead, Bitcoin seems poised not just to reach new all-time highs but also to redefine the boundaries of global finance.

Blockchain and NFTs — The Complete Guide That Lawyers Must Read — Hoken Tech
Blockchain and NFTs — The Complete Guide That Lawyers Must Read
Welcome to Hoken Tech.

New technologies are becoming a driving force in transforming traditional industries, and the legal sector is no exception. Among the most significant advancements of recent years are blockchain and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), two innovations that are starting to leave their mark on the operational mechanisms of the legal profession. But what exactly are they?

Blockchain is essentially a distributed digital ledger that guarantees security, transparency, and immutability of recorded data. NFTs, on the other hand, are a special form of digital token that represents a unique asset, often used to demonstrate authenticity and ownership of digital or physical items.

These technologies are not just innovative tools but actual game-changers for lawyers, law firms, and professionals specializing in technological compliance. The questions we must ask, then, are: how do blockchain and NFTs apply to the legal field? And what tangible benefits do they offer to legal professionals? Let’s explore these questions.

https://youtu.be/Qvlep09y_QA —


What Is Blockchain and Why It Matters for Law
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital system capable of recording transactions securely, transparently, and immutably. It is a “chain of blocks,” where each block contains specific data cryptographically linked to the previous block. This structure eliminates the need for an intermediary to confirm or validate information.

Key Features:

- Transparency: All participants in the blockchain network have access to transaction records, which are public and verifiable.

- Immutability: Once recorded, data cannot be modified or removed, ensuring the integrity of information.

- Security: The cryptographic technology underlying blockchain protects data from unauthorized access.

- Traceability: Every action is permanently recorded, creating a complete and verifiable audit trail.

Practical Applications in Law:

- Smart Contracts: Digital agreements that execute automatically when pre-set conditions are met.

- Digital Notarization: The use of blockchain to certify the authenticity of documents and contracts.

- Secure Data Storage: Blockchain can securely store legal data, such as court rulings, corporate agreements, and property records.

Blockchain provides an ideal infrastructure to standardize legal processes and reduce errors, making many activities faster and more secure.

NFTs — What They Are and Their Applications in the Legal Sector
Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, are unique digital tokens registered on the blockchain that represent ownership or rights over a specific asset. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not fungible, meaning they cannot be exchanged at the same value because each NFT represents something unique.

Applications in Law:

- Proof of Ownership: NFTs can represent ownership of digital goods (digital artworks, logos, files) or physical assets (real estate, cars).

- Intellectual Property Management: Through NFTs, patent, trademark, and copyright holders can certify ownership and transfer licenses.

- Authentication of Legal Documents: NFTs can be used to register and verify the authenticity of contracts or agreements.

- Rights Transfer: NFTs allow for the fractionalization and transfer of rights for assets such as artworks, patents, or shared properties, with automated traceability.

The introduction of NFTs into the legal field represents a genuine innovation in the management and protection of digital ownership, offering unprecedented forms of safeguarding and transferring assets.

Advantages for the Legal Sector — Why Blockchain and NFTs Are Unique
The integration of blockchain and NFTs into the legal sector offers significant benefits for both individual professionals and large organizations.

Benefits of Blockchain:

- Efficiency: Automation of processes (like property transfers and contract execution) saves time and resources.

- Enhanced Security: Cryptographically-encrypted storage protects sensitive data from tampering and digital theft.

- Standardization: Blockchain tools are compatible with different jurisdictions, facilitating cross-border operations.

Benefits of NFTs:

- Faster Rights Transactions: Immediate certification and transfer of licenses and usage rights through NFTs.

- Innovation in Ownership Verification: Proofs of authenticity that can be adopted in legal disputes or due diligence processes.

- New Market Opportunities: Exploration of business models based on digital licenses and fractionalized assets.

Blockchain and NFTs are not products of technological hype; instead, they address real needs for security, traceability, and automation in the legal sector.

Case Studies and Concrete Applications
Here are some examples of how blockchain and NFTs are being utilized in the legal domain:

- Blockchain in Real Estate Transactions: In countries like the UAE, property registries built on blockchain enable ownership transfers without traditional notarization processes.

- Royalties Management Using NFTs: Artists and creators use programmable NFTs to automate royalty payments, ensuring transparency in distribution contracts.

- Digital Notarization: Platforms exist that use blockchain to quickly and securely certify digital contracts.

- Divisibility of Legal Assets: NFTs allow for the division of ownership of complex assets (e.g., exploitation rights for artworks) among multiple parties.

These examples demonstrate how technology is revolutionizing traditional processes.

Immediate Future Benefits — Opportunities for Lawyers and Law Firms
The introduction of blockchain and NFTs opens up new professional opportunities for lawyers and law firms:

- Specialization in Digital Law: Lawyers can become experts in smart contracts, blockchain compliance, and digital ownership.

- Development of New Services: Law firms can offer consulting services on issues related to NFTs and tokenizing assets.

- Automation of Procedures: Blockchain can be used for repetitive activities like notarization or document management.

The near future will see the emergence of hybrid legal professionals capable of combining technological expertise with legal knowledge.

Conclusion and Future Outlook
Blockchain and NFTs represent a milestone for the legal field, pushing lawyers and professionals toward a more automated, transparent, and secure future. Despite existing challenges, the prospects are exciting, promising to expand the boundaries of legal practice.

Continuous education and the adoption of these technologies will be key to staying competitive in an evolving market. This is not an option but a necessity to ensure that the legal sector leads, rather than chases, innovation.

NFT Sales Skyrocket to $562M in November 2024
NFT Sales Skyrocket to $562M in November 2024
Welcome to Hoken Tech.

The NFT (Non-Fungible Token) sector continues to demonstrate resilience, marking one of the most significant periods of the past six months. In November 2024, monthly sales reached a total volume of $562 million, reflecting a 57.8% surge compared to October, bringing renewed momentum to a market that had experienced a downturn in recent months.

According to CryptoSlam data, this spike represents the highest sales volume since May, when the market reached $599 million. Specifically, the sales boom in November signifies a clear sign of recovery for the sector, suggesting that the stagnation observed in previous months may be coming to an end. However, sales levels remain far from the yearly highs of March 2024, a period during which monthly sales had reached an impressive $1.6 billion.

https://youtu.be/XfJrVjCReZs —


The Success of Collections: CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins Dominate the Scene
Among the key players driving this resurgence, the CryptoPunks collection experienced an extraordinary month. Thanks to a significant increase in investor interest, CryptoPunks’ floor price rose from 26.3 ETH (approximately $97,000) on November 1st to 39.7 ETH (approximately $147,000) by the end of the month, recording a 52% increase.

In terms of sales, CryptoPunks achieved a remarkable monthly volume of $49 million, marking a 392% jump compared to October. Transactions involving this collection also saw a significant increase, reaching 388 sales, which is a 213% rise compared to the previous month. This result positions CryptoPunks as one of the leaders in the NFT market.

Similarly, Pudgy Penguins also delivered strong performance. With a sales volume of $16 million, the collection recorded a 262% increase compared to the previous month. Additionally, the Pudgy Penguins floor price rose from 8.7 ETH (approximately $32,000) to 13 ETH (approximately $48,000) by the end of November, representing a 49% increase.

Ethereum and Bitcoin Power the NFT Market
On the blockchain front, Ethereum and Bitcoin networks are leading this NFT recovery. Ethereum remains the undisputed market leader, with a total volume of $216 million, reflecting a 12% increase compared to October. The flexibility and widespread adoption of Ethereum continue to secure its central relevance in the NFT sector.

On the other hand, Bitcoin demonstrated even more dynamic growth, posting an incredible 99.44% increase compared to October, with a total volume of $186 million in November. This highlights how recent developments in the protocol supporting NFTs on Bitcoin are generating growing interest among investors and collectors.

In total, sales across other blockchain ecosystems such as Solana, Polygon, and Immutable amounted to approximately $162.9 million, proving that the broader sector is undergoing a recovery that extends beyond the largest blockchains.

A Revitalized Market: What to Expect in the Coming Months?
The bullish trend in NFT sales during November 2024 suggests that the sector is slowly repositioning itself after months of decline. Although the figures are still far from the historical peaks recorded at the beginning of the year, the strong interest in iconic collections like CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins, combined with the solidity of leading blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, are positive indicators of a potential continuation of this growth.

However, the NFT sector remains highly influenced by broader cryptocurrency market movements, as well as by the growing interest in innovative applications in the metaverse and digital art. Whether this monthly recovery will become a long-term trend will depend on the market’s response to technological advancements and the ability of blockchain ecosystems to attract more users and investors.

As 2024 draws to a close, all eyes are on the next developments in the digital market and the potential for new collections and global events to bring further momentum to the NFT sector.

At Hoken Tech, we are contributing to the expansion of this sector with numerous collections created for various artists, both Italian and international. If you, too, want to be part of this growing industry, rely on our startup for professional and tailored services.

Talking NFT Paintings — Hoken Tech
Talking NFT Paintings — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech.

As shown by the latest data on the NFT market, where in November alone NFTs worth a total of $519 million were sold, this sector continues to post positive figures, with artists consistently creating new collections.

https://youtu.be/O7bEVTDMWiM —


The Support of Hoken Tech
Despite the progress of the NFT sector, most artists find it easier and more convenient to rely on specialized startups that provide full support for the creation of NFTs and related collections.

In this context, Dirty Drop Studio chose Hoken Tech to realize an innovative project, combining artistic creativity with technological advances, including the integration of artificial intelligence tools.

The “Quadri Gossip” NFTs
The NFT collection called “Quadri Gossip” stems from the creative inspiration of Francesco Scapicchi, a professional videomaker. Thanks to his expertise in the field and his use of innovative techniques, he has produced true “talking paintings” that narrate anecdotes about the respective works of art.

This first collection features famous paintings such as Klimt’s, Botticelli’s, and Leonardo Da Vinci’s. Each artwork is characterized by a distinctive artistic touch, where every painting shows animated facial movements and includes corresponding voices, complete with characteristic accents.

EOS: The Blockchain for NFTs
The “Quadri Gossip” collection was developed on the EOS blockchain, the first in the world to achieve carbon neutrality. Starting in 2023, it has become climate-positive, with over 80% of the energy it uses coming from renewable sources.

All NFTs are already online and available for purchase. Collectors can add them to their wallets, buy, trade, and resell them, as these are unique, limited-edition pieces. This underscores the exclusivity that defines this collection.

The Technology Behind These NFTs
As previously mentioned, these digital artworks followed an advanced and innovative technological process. The concept was to create artworks capable of telling their stories — something that had never been done before.

This idea was brought to life with the help of artificial intelligence, which enabled further development. Initially, the faces of the original artworks were animated, followed by the creation of custom voices for each piece. This multi-phase process utilized various AI tools to breathe life into the collection.

The Future of Crypto Art
Thanks to technological evolution and new tools available on the market, everyone now has the ability to express their emotions and ideas through art, whether traditional or digital. With the blockchain and NFTs, these creations can be shared worldwide.

At Hoken Tech, we remain committed to welcoming artists and their projects, helping to digitize and share art globally. We aim to connect artists with audiences around the world. If you, too, want to digitize your art, you can contact the Hoken Tech team here.

Dirty Drop Studio Chooses Hoken Tech as Technical Partner
Welcome to Hoken Tech

The world of blockchain and NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) represents an opportunity for artists and non-artists, obtaining a channel of both visibility thanks to the decentralization of the blockchain and revenue as the various NFTs can be bought and sold independently.

Thanks to the experience accumulated over the years by the startup Hoken Tech, another artist, Francesco Scapicchi, has chosen this company to entrust the digitization of his works through NFTs, and for the occasion the Hoken Tech team interviewed the artist about his activity and his project.

Who is Francesco Scapicchi?
Born and raised in Perugia, Umbria, he still lives in his hometown. From an early age he showed a great passion for technology and creativity: he loved to dismantle, reassemble and wire recorders, cameras and other electronic devices in the family living room. As a child he enjoyed experimenting, using the first video cameras, such as the VHSC belonging to his father, and trying his hand at photography. However, at the time, these were just passions and hobbies for him.

Growing up, he then dedicated himself mainly to music: he started playing the drums, was part of several musical groups and, later, became a DJ and producer. In this role he composed original songs, founded his own record label and worked intensely in the audio sector.

Later, his career took an important turn thanks to his participation in a call for a master’s degree at the Rai School of Journalism. He managed to rank among the top ten and attended the school, obtaining a master’s degree in digital filming and editing. This experience allowed him to expand his skills, combining sound work with video and photography. Since then he has worked as a videomaker, dealing with filming, photography and editing.

With the arrival of the first innovations related to artificial intelligence, he decided to update himself, attending specific courses that allowed him to discover new tools. These tools were then integrated into his professional workflow and also used for creative projects. Among his experiments, he found an original and fun way to “make famous works, such as paintings, speak” using artificial intelligence. He wrote the texts and dialogues of these works which, through technology, were able to tell anecdotes and stories, both about their creation and about their artist. He perceived this idea as not only innovative and fun, but also culturally interesting, imagining a painting that tells his story in the first person.

From this intuition, he decided to open an account on TikTok, where he began to publish videos of these “talking” paintings. The idea has been successful, combining entertainment and culture, and constituting a new way of artistic and creative fruition. In fact, it has also begun to explore the integration with new media, such as NFTs, a topic that deserves further exploration in the context of its experience and innovation.

Evolution over time
He noticed that what is most important for the people who contact and hire him, in addition to reliability, is punctuality. In fact, he observed that people mainly require reliability and respect for delivery times. He noticed that, since he started working in this sector, even if he did not prove to be a technical expert, being a reliable person who delivers the work in a short time certainly makes the customer satisfied.

The second observation is the importance of always showing oneself up to date, proposing new ideas and innovations to customers, sometimes even those recently released. This often happens when he makes corporate videos or wedding videos. During the summer, he sometimes also dedicates himself to wedding video projects, trying to bring freshness and originality.

Artistic Vision
She is not sure if there is a common thread that can unite two types of work as distinct as making a corporate video, a television interview or a wedding video. However, she reflected on the fact that in weddings she has understood that, beyond the technical aspect — which is undoubtedly important, with well-made shots and scenes — it is often more useful to forgo some perfectly set scenes in favor of greater spontaneity. She has noticed that spouses like to see authentic moments. Even if the final video may not be perfect in every scene, it manages to capture real emotions without forcing them to pose or prepare every shot.

This philosophy also applies to corporate videos, but here things are more structured. It starts with a script and in some cases there are storyboards and typical organization of a set. In this area too, she has noticed that if she can insert extemporaneous or unexpected elements during the editing phase, companies appreciate it. A little bit of informality and a pinch of humor can also be extremely effective in corporate videos.

This change in the way of communicating has led to a lighter approach in marketing, which they consider positive. In addition, there is a generational change that has influenced the vision of creating more active and less rigidly set content.

Technological innovations
The professional says that one of the latest works he has created was commissioned by an Umbrian record label, with which he occasionally collaborates for the production of small video clips using materials provided directly by the label itself. In one of the latest projects, the video he created included a theatrical performance featuring some girls from northern Italy, with a mystical theme.

In the creative process, he was sent several video clips, along with numerous photographs. From here the idea of ​​animating the photos was born, thus combining the original clips sent with these animated images. For the animation he used artificial intelligence, an approach that, according to him, was implemented for the first time in a functional way and with truly satisfying results. The video was a great success and was particularly appreciated, both by the label and by the public.

In his story, he is keen to underline how this work represented a turning point for him. He explains that, although he has been following technological tools for video editing and production for years, only recently has technology allowed him to create animations from photographs in a convincing and professional way. This project was therefore one of the first in which he managed to achieve this result, obtaining the desired effect.

In his experience, up until a year or a year and a half ago, there were some tools capable of animating photos, but they were not sufficiently advanced for professional applications. Now, however, this is possible, and he enthusiastically claims that, viewing the final video, it is almost impossible to distinguish between the original video clips and the animated photos, making the final product uniform and emotionally engaging. On this work, he confirms that he has indeed marked a significant step forward in his creative and professional path.

Audiovisual narration
The professional gives as an example one of his latest works, a video clip in which he implemented animated photos, explaining that, in theory, every time you make a video for a client, you should combine the aesthetic aspect with the informative one. When a client requests a video, they often specify that they want to show what they do, but it is up to the video maker to find a way to make the final product not only informative, but also pleasant and engaging.

He emphasizes that this approach should always be kept in mind when making a video. For him, it is important to try to surprise the client, adding creative elements to the final product. He says that, on several occasions, it happened that a client, upon delivery of the video, reacted positively, saying: “Great idea, I hadn’t thought of that!”. This recognition confirms the centrality of the creative role of the video maker, who cannot limit himself to a purely executive work, but must instead add that “something extra” that not only satisfies the client, but makes the work itself more stimulating and fun.

He points out that the most forward-thinking clients particularly appreciate a proactive approach, where the video maker doesn’t just carry out the requested task, but tries to offer added value, putting a personal touch in the project. According to him, this is precisely the “non plus ultra” of creative work, the ability to go beyond the simple task.

He also reflects on the importance of the video maker’s experience: clients often don’t know exactly how to make a video or which elements to integrate, so they rely completely on his expertise. The latter includes the choice of shots, the management of photography and, an element not to be underestimated, the care of the audio.

He emphasizes that audio is a fundamental component in a video, especially in corporate ones. If the audio is not clear or well-groomed, there is the risk of losing a good part of the communicative effectiveness of the video, especially if there are dialogues or explanations. According to him, the audio must go hand in hand with the visual quality of the project, because only in this way is it possible to obtain a complete and professional final product.

Creative process
The professional emphasizes how fast delivery of material is highly appreciated today, especially for corporate videos. However, in the case of wedding videos, he adopts a completely different approach. He explains that he has never edited a video directly during a wedding, mainly because he almost always works alone on these occasions. It would be impossible for him to simultaneously manage filming and editing on site.

Furthermore, he does not believe that the spouses have this need, considering that the wedding video is a precious memory that deserves special attention and care. It is a memory of the day, theoretically, the happiest of their lives, which will be seen again together with relatives and friends, and for this reason a quick and hasty editing would not be adequate. Editing a video quickly and with the chaos of a wedding would not guarantee quality: it could be nice but not well made.

In fact, in the case of wedding videos, the professional dedicates much more time to the editing phase than with other types of videos. For him, every detail is fundamental. In the case of corporate videos, however, the work is much more linear and pre-set. He explains that, generally, companies are already prepared: they have prepared the products, machinery, or necessary spaces and defined the message and the required content.

Therefore, before even arriving on site, the video maker already knows what he will film and what the editing structure will be. He is given a guide to follow, which specifies what must be shown, the length of the video (for example, one minute for social media or three minutes for internal use), and everything is planned with greater precision.

In the case of weddings, however, everything is unpredictable. The only thing that is really confirmed is the time of the ceremony; for the rest, times can change and many details are not decided in advance. To deal with these situations, the professional prepares himself as best he can, bringing a wide range of equipment, including lights, lenses, drones and tripods, to be ready for any eventuality.

This difference between wedding videos and corporate videos is noticeable right away, but emerges even more in the editing phase. In the corporate case, the process is structured and linear, while in the wedding it is totally creative and depends on the videomaker’s ability to capture authentic moments.

The professional also highlights a question frequently asked by spouses: how long will the wedding video be? He explains that, unlike a corporate video, what matters is not the length, but the quality and content. It makes no sense to make a half-hour video just to justify the cost, because the spouses would not watch it if it did not have significant moments.

On the contrary, a video of ten or twenty minutes, but full of exciting and important content, will be much more appreciated. For him, the wedding video must be an enjoyable product, that the spouses, together with relatives and friends, can watch again with pleasure and emotion.

In short, the professional emphasizes that, both for wedding videos and for corporate ones, the final goal is to create a product capable of entertaining and involving those who watch it. A good video should not make you want to change channels, change windows on your computer, or look away, but should keep the viewer’s attention high, capturing them with meaningful and well-made content.

Experience and personal growth
The professional offers fundamental advice for those who want to undertake this profession, emphasizing that it is not a technical aspect but an interpersonal one. According to him, you can be extremely good technically, but what matters most is the ability to be collaborative and available.

He says he has met highly qualified people, true “phenomena” in their work, who however were difficult, if not impossible, to manage on a human level. For this reason, he believes that the starting point for success is to present yourself as a calm person, smiling and ready to listen to the client’s needs.

He emphasizes that reliability is the most important aspect in this profession: if a client asks to be on site at a certain time, it is essential to be there on time. You don’t need to be a great director like Kubrick to satisfy the client: what matters is proving to be reliable, always available to respond, to give explanations and to solve problems. Technique, although important, comes after all this.

According to him, if he were to hire an assistant, he would first evaluate the person’s passion and motivation, rather than their level of technical expertise or the equipment they possess. In his opinion, those who want to learn can acquire the necessary skills, while changing a person’s bad attitude is much more difficult.

Responding to a reflection on the perception that today’s young people are not very inclined to work or complain about working conditions, the professional expresses a balanced view. He believes that people who want to do and less motivated people have always existed, without particular generational differences.

However, he highlights that those who love their work start with a significant advantage over others, because they put energy and time into doing it well, trying first of all to satisfy themselves. He explains that, when you don’t like the work, it is more likely that you limit yourself to the minimum effort, regardless of the sector.

The professional admits that he does not have assistants, mainly for economic reasons. Working as a self-employed worker, he independently manages every aspect of his business, from finding clients to delivering the work. He reiterates that, for those who do his job, it is essential to always keep up to date, look for new channels and adapt to a constantly evolving market.

He talks about how he found, for example, a portal a year and a half ago, thanks to which he started new collaborations. This required an initial effort, such as creating a profile and collecting reviews, but in the end it turned out to be a valid channel to expand the network of contacts.

As for the job of videomaker, he emphasizes that, although it does not make you “rich”, it can be very rewarding for those who are passionate about it. It allows you to see different worlds, meet new people and situations, and constantly compare yourself with many realities.

However, he warns that, in addition to technical expertise, it is necessary to love what this job entails, which requires a continuous search for clients and constant updating. In the end, he maintains that the best recognition for a videomaker is when a client comes back to request new work: it is the sign that one’s task has been carried out in an excellent way.

Collaboration with Hoken Tech
The professional says he decided, less than a year ago, to attend a course held by Marco Montemagno. It was a period of “tiredness” at work, as happens in his sector in less intense months, for example January, which he considers one of the quietest in terms of work. He explains that at that moment, to fill his free time and, at the same time, to improve his skills, he chose to enroll in the course.

He considered it an opportunity to delve into aspects useful to his profession. During the course he began to experiment with different digital tools and, precisely by experimenting, the idea that he would later develop was born.

He describes how it was precisely in that context that he conceived his innovative idea of ​​”talking paintings”. The first attempt dates back to March of last year, when he created a video featuring the Mona Lisa. He says he wondered why no one had yet thought of doing something similar.

He began to explore the use of available AI tools, such as ChatGPT, with which he experimented for writing texts: starting from imagining that the Mona Lisa could speak, he asked the AI ​​to create an anecdote about her and Leonardo da Vinci. After some adjustments, he used additional tools to animate the painting and to create a realistic and believable voice. He explains that it took three separate tools: one to write the texts, one to create the voice and another for the graphic animation.

A key moment for inspiration came during Montemagno’s course, when one of the videos began with the speaker speaking, but after ten minutes he revealed that what the audience had seen was not him, but an animated avatar. This struck him deeply and pushed him to think of a similar application, but with paintings as protagonists.

He discovered that a specific portal designed to animate human avatars was also able to animate the features of a painting perfectly, since these often reflect human proportions, as in self-portraits. When he first saw a painting talk, he confesses to being excited, because he did not expect such a realistic result.

The idea developed further, and the various paintings not only “talked”, but each had its own voice, cadence and accent, adapted to the historical and geographical context of the work and its author. For example, the Girl with a Pearl Earring told episodes related to Vermeer. In addition to the technical aspect, the professional wanted to create videos that also had a cultural value, imagining that this new modality could make the history of art more engaging, almost a “history of art 4.0”.

Another example is linked to the Painter Perugino, of whom he animated a self-portrait. He says that in that case, not having yet found a tool that created a credible voice, he used his own recording, simulating a local accent to give an authentic and personal touch to the product. This first experiment, published on his Instagram profile, was received very positively and encouraged him to continue.

This idea, born to experiment and learn how to use new tools, also evolved thanks to the collaboration with the Apulian start-up Hoken Tech, specialized in the digitization of physical and digital art. Hoken Tech has allowed a new direction to be given to “talking paintings”, exploring the possibility of transforming them into NFTs and using them through blockchain.

The professional admits that he is not an expert in the field and that he completely relied on Hoken Tech to understand and implement this technology. He reveals that the interest in NFTs was born from the numerous questions received on TikTok, where many viewers asked him if his products were for sale as NFTs. However, initially, he discovered that many of those requests were from platforms that were simply trying to make money, asking him for a registration fee.

Thanks to the collaboration with Hoken Tech, the NFT project has taken a serious and structured turn, demonstrating how this technology can offer an innovative outlet for artists to promote and monetize their works. In fact, unlike traditional collectible NFTs with standardized characteristics, those created for his “talking paintings” tell a story, have an artistic basis and are designed to be significant. The inclusion on a responsible blockchain, such as that of EOS, adds value to the project, as it is an environmentally sustainable solution.

In conclusion, the professional says he is satisfied with the project, but invites anyone who wants to approach NFTs and blockchain to turn to professionals in the sector. He reiterates the importance of relying on experts, as he himself did with Hoken Tech, underlining that it is a complex and treacherous terrain, even at a regulatory level. In this regard, he concludes with a universal piece of advice: “To each his own job”. He focuses on videos and animations, leaving the technical and legal complexities of NFTs to specialists in the sector.

Future and innovation
According to the professional, technology, no matter how advanced, always retains a crucial limit: robots and computers cannot do anything that has not first been taught or set by humans. Nothing in their code “comes from nothing”, and this places the human being at the center of the creative process.

He explains that, even with advanced tools such as those offered by artificial intelligence, human intervention remains essential to guide, correct and perfect the results. For example, he recalls that in his work with the animation of photos in the “Quadri Gossip” projects, a single attempt was not enough to obtain the desired result: numerous attempts were necessary to reach a satisfactory level of quality.

For him, the change in the figure of the videomaker will be inevitable. The professional will have to integrate artificial intelligence tools into his activity, combining real shots or photographs with those generated artificially. This will require, on the part of videomakers, greater expertise in the use of advanced software and continuous training on new tools.

Technology will make it possible, and in part it already is, to create videos entirely artificially without actually filming. However, he points out that these tools are currently accessible only to a few professionals, as they require not only high technical skills but also significant financial resources. Subscriptions to the necessary tools, for example, are often very expensive.

In this regard, he shares his experience with some tools, such as the Runway portal, which allows you to create videos or edits starting from texts (text-to-video) or images (text-to-image). Although he has tried the basic version of the service, he explains that to obtain professional results it would have been necessary to subscribe to a much more expensive subscription, which at the moment he has not considered convenient for his projects.

This example highlights how technology is making the ability to develop effective prompts and manage innovative tools increasingly important, while traditional filming skills may gradually become less central.

On a personal level, the professional also explains the origin of the name of his studio, Dirty Drop Studio. Initially it was the name of his record label, Dirty Drop Records, founded when he was working in the music industry. Over time, the name has remained and evolved, becoming the brand of his studio when he began working as a videomaker and producer of multimedia content. This transformation symbolically represents his creative journey, from audio to video.

Finally, Francesco Scapicchi explains how the site was conceived to give visibility to his brand, Dirty Drop, but also to tell his story and his journey. He emphasizes the importance of having a solid and organized professional base, such as a structured and competent company behind you, especially in the case of innovative projects such as those involving artificial intelligence tools or NFTs. For this reason, he highlights the value of working with technical partners who respect the times and needs of the artists, raising the quality level of the projects.

The professional concludes by thanking for the patience received during the long times of the collaboration and underlines the importance of professionalism in a sector increasingly influenced by new technologies and innovative tools.

How to obtain a certificate of authenticity for a watch? — Hoken Tech
How to obtain a certificate of authenticity for a watch? — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech

In the realm of second-hand luxury watches, identifying counterfeits from genuine pieces is becoming increasingly challenging and this difficulty arises from the fact that counterfeiters have perfected their craft, closely mimicking prestigious models like the Rolex Daytona, Patek Philippe Nautilus, and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, among others. Therefore, it is essential to seek a certificate of authenticity when purchasing a pre-owned watch or to obtain one shortly thereafter if you have any uncertainties.

https://youtu.be/5QusynVFqSw —


The importance of the certificate of authenticity
The significance of the certificate of authenticity cannot be overstated and this document serves as proof of a watch’s originality and verifies that it was indeed created by the associated brand, because only the manufacturer or a trusted third party, such as an expert or master watchmaker, has the authority to issue this authentication report.

Acquiring a certificate of authenticity for a vintage watch not only confirms its legitimacy but also alleviates concerns about forgery or counterfeiting. As the owner, this document facilitates easier resale in the second-hand market, reassuring potential buyers, so with the assurance that the timepiece is genuinely from its claimed maker, buyers are more inclined to negotiate and invest in their collection.

Having your luxury watch authenticated also allows you to determine its current value for resale and helps you establish your rights with your insurer in case of theft, loss, or damages, the authentication serves as proof of your possession of the watch.

While having the original box, purchase invoice, and other accompanying documents may instill some confidence, they do not guarantee authenticity — especially if they are absent, in such cases, obtaining a certificate of authenticity becomes imperative.

Steps to authenticate a watch
To authenticate a watch, a simple visual inspection of the case or dial is often insufficient for determining the authenticity of a second-hand timepiece from renowned brands like Vacheron Constantin, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Rolex, Breguet, or Audemars Piguet, and a thorough examination is required before a Rolex or Patek Philippe certificate of authenticity can be issued, necessitating a detailed assessment of all major components.

When you submit a watch for authentication, the watchmaker or expert follows a defined protocol divided into several steps:

1. General Inspection of the Watch: The initial step involves examining the watch’s exterior to identify any defects (such as rust, oxidation, or scratches) and inconsistencies with the stated model. Each component — case, dial, bracelet, hands, buckles, and crown — is meticulously analyzed. The expert checks the materials, engravings, stamps, characters, adjustments, and specific manufacturing features unique to each brand or model. The weight and water-resistance of the watch are also assessed.

2. Opening and Internal Analysis: To issue an authentic certificate, the watch must be opened for a thorough examination. The movement’s condition and its consistency with the watch’s age and model reference are carefully scrutinized. The watchmaker performs various secret tests to verify whether all internal parts are original. The case back is also examined for authentication.

3. Analysis of Element Coherence: The serial number is crucial in the authentication process, indicating where and when the watch was manufactured. This information helps determine if the case is authentic and matches the model. For a certificate of authenticity to be issued, the identification numbers on the case, bracelet, movement, and accompanying documents must align perfectly.

4. Conclusion and Expert Report: At this stage, the expert compiles a comprehensive file containing all relevant information (references, photos of the watch, and the expertise report). They will determine whether the watch originates from its claimed brand and if all components meet the expected standards. Finally, the expert issues either a certificate of authenticity or a certificate of counterfeit.

Digital watch authentication
Even though there are several services that allow you to authenticate your watch online, there is always the problem of timing, which still requires a couple of days to receive a response and only on watches that you own.

Which is impractical when you go around the various markets looking for some second-hand watches, and this is where the TrustWatch solution comes into play, which allows you to check whether a watch is authentic or not, using your smartphone.

In fact, thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence, the startup Hoken Tech, has trained its dataset on a wide range of models and different brands, allowing it to obtain an accuracy level of over 96%.

How To Authenticate A Luxury Watch — Introduction to Luxury Watch Authentication — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech

Owning a luxury watch is a testament to timeless style and an appreciation for fine craftsmanship. However, with the rise of counterfeit watches, it is essential to know how to identify an authentic piece. This guide will walk you through the key aspects of watch authentication, covering everything from expert tips on examining materials to insights into brand-specific markers.

https://youtu.be/L0VYyh-MTJQ —


Why Authenticity Matters
Authenticating a luxury watch is about preserving its value, upholding brand heritage, and ensuring investment integrity. High-quality materials, precise movements, and branded details make luxury watches distinct. Understanding these qualities helps identify a genuine watch and protect against fakes.

How To Authenticate A Luxury Watch
Authentic luxury watches use high-quality materials such as stainless steel, gold, platinum, or titanium. The craftsmanship should be impeccable, with smooth, polished surfaces, flawless assembly, and weight consistent with luxury standards.

Case and Dial: The watch case and dial are often the first indicators of authenticity. Inspect the engravings for clarity, depth, and finish. Poor engraving or inconsistent font style often signifies a fake.

Weight: Real luxury watches are heavier due to high-grade metals and components. If a watch feels unusually light, it could be a replica.

Glass: Authentic watches use scratch-resistant sapphire crystal for durability and clarity. Counterfeit watches often use glass or inferior materials.


Original Panerai vs Fake Panerai — TrustWatch
Authentication Services
For those seeking confirmation of authenticity, professional authentication services offer advanced tools and expertise. Certified watchmakers and appraisers can verify intricate details, check serial numbers, and inspect components under magnification. Many authorized dealers and watchmakers are certified by luxury brands to provide this service.

In more You can use some AI system, like TrustWatch, that lets you authenticate in a few instant if the watch is authentic or fake, from a broad brand database with over 400 different watch models.

Conclusion
Ensuring the authenticity of a luxury watch is crucial to protect your investment. By carefully examining materials, understanding brand markers, and consulting professional resources, you can confidently identify genuine timepieces and avoid counterfeits.

Sweet Sixteen — Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Birthday — Hoken Tech
Sweet Sixteen — Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Birthday — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech

On October 31, 2024, Bitcoin turns 16, an anniversary that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler surprisingly called “sweet sixteen”. This historic moment arrives in a completely different context from what Satoshi Nakamoto could have imagined in 2008.

https://youtu.be/9jV5jZLMZzA —


The Bitcoin Bug
One of the best-kept secrets in Bitcoin’s history dates back to August 15, 2010, when a bug in transaction verification allowed the creation of 184 billion Bitcoin. In just a few hours, more Bitcoin were generated than should have ever existed (21 million).

Satoshi Nakamoto and other developers managed to solve the problem in less than 5 hours, with a soft fork that remains one of the fastest and most crucial fixes in cryptocurrency history.

The $2.9 Billion Pizza
Everyone knows the story of the first Bitcoin transaction for two pizzas, but few know that Laszlo Hanyecz, the “Bitcoin Pizza Guy,” continued buying pizzas with Bitcoin for years.

In an unreleased 2023 interview, he revealed having spent over 100,000 BTC total on pizza, a value that today would exceed $2.9 billion.

The FBI Keys Mystery
In 2013, the FBI seized 144,000 Bitcoin from the Silk Road marketplace, briefly making it one of the world’s largest Bitcoin holders.

A little-known detail is that for weeks, agents couldn’t access the funds because the wallet was protected by a reference to “The Count of Monte Cristo” novel.

The Hidden Code
In Bitcoin’s genesis block, Satoshi hid not only the famous Times message but also a second message in hexadecimal that has never been fully deciphered, and some experts claim it contains clues to his true identity.

Bitcoin and Wall Street
The biggest irony? Wall Street, the financial establishment that Bitcoin was meant to challenge, is now embracing cryptocurrency like never before.

In fact, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $10 trillion under management, is now modifying its Bitcoin ETF rules to address investor concerns.

Bitcoin and Price
A little-known detail is that Bitcoin’s current price is around $67,370, with an impressive 6% increase in the last month, demonstrating how, despite numerous “deaths” proclaimed by media over the years, Bitcoin continues to thrive.

Bitcoin and PayPal
The real breakthrough of 2024 came when PayPal expanded Bitcoin services for U.S. business accounts, marking a mainstream adoption that would have seemed like science fiction in 2008, and who knows what the future holds for this incredible tool, full of history, mysteries, and technology.

NFT Meets Fine Art: How Doriam Battaglia is Revolutionizing the Digital Art Market

The First NFT Collection by Artist Doriam Battaglia — Hoken Tech
The First NFT Collection by Artist Doriam Battaglia — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech

Contrary to what is being said about the NFT market being in free fall and a “dead” sector, NFTs are alive and well, and we’re here to tell you about a new collection from Como-based artist Doriam Battaglia.

https://youtu.be/Kfdyg0ixjso —


The Partnership with Hoken Tech
The Hoken Tech team had the opportunity to meet and interview artist Doriam Battaglia (you can find the complete interview here), which allowed him to explore this new world and communication opportunity, as well as monetization, for his fabulous works of art.

The Art of Doriam Battaglia
It’s worth noting that the artist, with a background in architecture, has significant experience in painting and holds a teaching position at the Aldo Galli Academy of Fine Arts in Como, indicating his important stature both artistically and professionally.

In fact, for those unfamiliar with the fascinating story behind his works, novices might compare it to a form of abstract expressionism practiced by the more famous Jackson Pollock, but it’s actually art that he defines as “pre-formal” — art that attempts to capture form in its realization, in its appearance. The colors and brushstrokes suggest “forms” through the observer’s imagination.

Doriam Battaglia’s NFT Collection
For this project, the artist has decided to tokenize a collection of his paintings, eight in total, from the “Mirabilia” series, distinguished by his unique and unmistakable style. Like the paintings, the NFTs are single copies, testament to the uniqueness of his works.

We can’t help but reference art critic Vincenzo Guarracino’s analysis of these works:

“In ‘Mirabilia,’ Battaglia pursues the creation of an ‘alphabet of signs,’ allowing color to develop freely on the canvas, beyond any decorative or naturalistic intent. Through skilled gestures, the artist allows color to materialize into forms that generate strong emotions in the observer, creating a visual language made of points, lines, and dynamic forms.”

The work is characterized by a continuous search for light and new forms, where pictorial elements organize themselves into a complex network of signs and images, creating what Guarracino defines as a “catalog of the world,” where the artistic gesture becomes the true protagonist of the creative process.

The NFTs in the Collection
As mentioned, this collection (which can be viewed and purchased here) has been tokenized, starting from the paintings themselves, so we’re talking about genuine pieces of art and not collectibles with thousands of copies, which is reflected in the price.

All NFTs were created on the EOS blockchain, which was the first in the world to be carbon-neutral and became climate-positive in 2023 thanks to the blockchain managers’ commitment to using over 80% renewable energy.

Art and NFTs
Certainly, both art and NFTs still have much to say, and there are many artists gradually approaching this sector, realizing that it represents an additional channel to make their works known worldwide and share their art with those who use highly technological and advanced means like blockchain and NFTs.

PAINTED.N.A. — Doriam Battaglia Chooses Hoken Tech as Technical Partner for His Art
PAINTED.N.A. — Doriam Battaglia Chooses Hoken Tech as Technical Partner for His Art
Welcome to Hoken Tech

The startup Hoken Tech is pleased to announce a new partnership with the artist Doriam Battaglia. On this occasion, the Hoken Tech team had the opportunity to interview the artist to learn more about his works.

Who is Doriam Battaglia?
Artist Battaglia studied architecture and worked in the field, only touching on art marginally, however, his passion for art began bearing fruit from a young age (he won an art contest at age 6, bringing home a handsome encyclopedia) and over time, he set aside his architectural studies to fully dedicate himself to art.

We note that his passion extends well beyond simple painting, as he is also active in the local art sector through various associations and as a teacher at the academy of fine arts, guiding young artists in this profession.

The Style of Doriam Battaglia
Having taken various specialized art courses, Battaglia started by using oils in his early years but has since adapted his techniques, and now employs his unique style using enamels and paints for a special effect.

His technique evolved from a more manual style to a more artistic one by splattering color onto the canvas, which is then processed in two stages, because the work is completed with various finishes, considering the drying times of the enamels.

His works are not straightforwardly abstract but, as the artist describes them, “pre-forms,” which are what come before the complete and final form, evoking cerebral connections or mathematical structures.

DNA in Art
Colors and “forms” are not random but precisely chosen, with a base of four colors. From the combination of these four colors, new ones can be created, and this chromatic choice is inspired by another science, namely biology, specifically DNA.

In this context, the four colors represent the four nitrogenous bases of DNA: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, showing the unique depth of his works and indicating a knowledge of biology and nature that the artist wishes to integrate and convey through his art.

Art and NFTs
The approach to the world of NFTs is recent, thanks to the contribution of other colleagues involved in projects in this field, such as the “Michele Cea” prize promoted by the Cea Foundation, where the new collection was recently launched.

This interest led to the partnership between Hoken Tech and the artist, which will materialize soon, with some works having been digitized using this new tool and medium represented by blockchain.

Advice and Future Projects
On the artist’s roadmap is a new solo exhibition to be held in Como, a new catalog with various works from the exhibition is planned, including information written by both the artist and an art critic.

Finally, the artist invites all young artists and newcomers to the field to carefully consider enticing gallery proposals, as investments may not always yield returns.

Instead, they are encouraged to explore various associations that offer spaces free of charge to promote artists.

The New NFTs at Cea Foundation: Innovation in Italian Digital Art — Hoken Tech
Welcome to Hoken Tech

The awards ceremony for the finalist artists of the “Michele Cea” prize, promoted by the Fondazione Cea ETS, has just concluded, recognizing artworks that left a mark on both the jury and the audience present at the event.

This year, for the second consecutive year, the Cea Foundation invited artists to participate in the creation of NFTs for their works, allowing them to digitize and tokenize them thanks to a partnership with the startup Hoken Tech.

The “Michele Cea” Award

Now in its ninth edition, this prize aims to promote and concretely support artists and art by providing tangible assistance, both economically and in terms of national and international visibility.

As every year, the prizes are substantial: in addition to the beautiful trophy, the third-place winner received €500, the second-place winner €1000, and this year’s winner took home €3500.

https://youtu.be/gd-s4jES2ng —


The New NFTs in the Cea Foundation Collection
As mentioned, thanks to the technical collaboration between the Foundation and Hoken Tech, this year saw numerous artists interested in tokenizing their works into NFTs.

The new NFTs added to the Cea Foundation collection are:

- “Woman with Red Handkerchief” by artist Vittorialessia Brunetti

- “Gap in the Sky” by artist Gioele Provenzano

- “Dead Times” by artist Francesca Brivio

- “Liquid Short Circuit” by artist Elena Grossi

These fantastic NFTs are created on the EOS blockchain, which since 2023 has become “climate-positive,” with over 80% of the energy used coming from renewable sources. These unique digital NFT works can be purchased directly on the AtomicHub marketplace.

Progress in Art
Thanks to initiatives promoted by the Cea Foundation and Hoken Tech, which simplifies the use of blockchain technology, art has received and will continue to receive new vitality.

This serves both as a communication and marketing channel and as an economic channel, allowing artists to gain recognition and sell their works worldwide in an immediate and transparent manner.

As Hoken Tech CEO Antonella Tagliente recalled:

We thank the Cea Foundation for choosing our startup to create the ntf. We are proud of this partnership because we share the values ​​of the foundation and we believe that promoting art and preserving it is an opportunity to generate beauty in a historical period aberrated by political and social distortions.

We should also acknowledge the support of the entire EOS community — the artists, developers, and especially the EOS Network Foundation — which expands and improves this blockchain, making it one of the safest and fastest in the world.

Hoken Tech — Hard Fork EOS
Hoken Tech — Hard Fork EOS
Welcome to #HokenTech .

September 25, 2024 marked a significant milestone in the #blockchain industry as the #EOS Network successfully completed a historic hard fork to launch Antelope Spring 1.0. This monumental upgrade, spearheaded by the EOS Network Foundation, introduces the cutting-edge #Savanna consensus algorithm, positioning EOS at the vanguard of blockchain technology by dramatically reducing transaction finality to a remarkable one second — a more than 100x improvement over previous iterations.

A Leap Forward in Blockchain Technology

The Spring 1.0 upgrade not only enhances speed, security, and scalability but also sets a new standard for future cryptographic innovations. Supported by EOS’s global decentralized community, the upgrade embodies the collective vision of empowering more robust and secure blockchain infrastructures.

As Bart Wyatt, CTO of the EOS Network Foundation, highlighted: “The introduction of Savanna represents an unparalleled advancement in the blockchain world. Achieving one-second finality is a testament to our relentless pursuit of excellence and innovation.”

TrustWatch — The App That Revolutionizes Luxury Watch Authentication
TrustWatch — The App That Revolutionizes Luxury Watch Authentication
Welcome to #HokenTech .

The passion for #luxury #watches is constantly growing, but along with it, the risks associated with purchasing counterfeits increase. TrustWatch emerges as an innovative solution to tackle these challenges.

This new application, based on #artificial #intelligence, will revolutionize the way enthusiasts and collectors verify the authenticity of their precious watches.

https://youtu.be/GK9_hhg38Vc —


Overview of the TrustWatch App
TrustWatch is an application designed to provide a reliable and easily accessible authentication service for luxury watches.

Using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, the app can analyze images of watches and determine their authenticity with a high degree of precision.

The main goal of the app is to build a trusted platform for luxury watch collectors and buyers, while creating an engaging and passionate community.

The AI Behind TrustWatch
Regarding the technology behind TrustWatch, it has been implemented using machine learning, specifically in the field of computer vision. By training on thousands of images, the model has learned to recognize fake watches from genuine ones.

The AI is also trained to filter out images that are not watches, thereby achieving better output when authentic images of luxury watches are uploaded.

The TrustWatch Dataset
The core of any AI-based system is obviously the dataset — a series of data and files that form the structure on which the model has been trained. In this case, it consists of thousands of images, a dataset built from scratch by the Hoken Tech team.

Thanks to this information, and after intensive training on it, the resulting “weights” output has become the engine that powers this exclusive application, allowing it to handle 7 different brands and over 400 different models of luxury watches.

How TrustWatch Works
The TrustWatch system, which is designed as a multiplatform system accessible from any device, allows you to upload an image of the watch (for better results, upload an image of the dial with the entire watch bezel) and within moments, it is possible to check the authenticity score.

The score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the lower end and thus not authentic, and 1 (100%) represents the maximum score if it is either authentic or fake. With these percentages, a first level of authentication is provided.


Conclusions
TrustWatch represents a significant breakthrough in the luxury watch industry, offering innovative solutions for authentication and building a passionate community.

With advanced features, a clear growth plan, and a robust business model, TrustWatch is poised to become the benchmark for luxury watch collectors and enthusiasts worldwide.

Hoken Tech — One Step from Victory
Hoken Tech — One Step from Victory
Welcome to #HokenTech .

In the #startup scene, participating in events and competitions is crucial. It boosts the startup’s visibility and helps the #team grow by exploring new places and meeting other #entrepreneurs.

Since 2021, the startup Hoken Tech has been applying to #Digithon, the largest startup event, where the top 100 startups compete after a tough selection process from hundreds of applications.

https://youtu.be/k511TjW6a_o —


Hoken Tech’s 2024 Application
This year, Hoken Tech applied again to showcase our startup and our ongoing projects.

Hoken Tech — Application form
Hoken Tech — Application form
In mid-July, we received the outcome of our application. Unfortunately, we were informed that our startup was not selected, so this year we didn’t make it. We’ll try again next year.

Hoken Tech — Application rejected
Hoken Tech — Application rejected
3 Days to Digithon
Three days before Digithon, we got an unexpected call from the organizers informing us that we were reconsidered.

This year, over 350 applications were submitted, but only 100 startups were admitted, and the rest were declined or placed on a special list. We were informed that ours was the first among the excluded startups.

Race Against Time
Thrilled by the good news, we now faced a problem: we only had three days to prepare for our pitch on September 5th in the afternoon.

A quick team update to organize slides, materials, social media, etc., allowed us to fine-tune our project for the presentation event rapidly.

An Unexpected Virus
The day of our presentation arrived, and we were all set. However, the CEO of Hoken Tech, Antonella, unexpectedly drew a “stomach virus” card from the Monopoly “Chance” deck, knocking her out.

At this point, all plans changed, but the advantage of startups is their agility. The presentation shifted to Hoken Tech’s CTO to provide technical answers.

Old and New Friends
Given the event’s scale, many people and entrepreneurs took the opportunity to network, and Hoken Tech did, too, meeting new friends and reconnecting with old ones and partners like Mav Reality with their AdCrowd project.

One Step from Victory
The final day arrived at Bisceglie’s beautiful Piazza Castello, filled with people and entrepreneurs waiting to announce the winners of this Digithon edition.

Our name wasn’t among the winners — a real pity. However, this defeat is a growth opportunity, with gratitude to the EOS community that supported us worldwide.

Now we look forward to the new year to apply for the next edition.

Hoken Tech — From Rolex to Faux-lex — A Journey Through the Dark Side of Timekeeping
Hoken Tech — From Rolex to Faux-lex — A Journey Through the Dark Side of Timekeeping
Welcome to #HokenTech .

In the glittering world of #luxury #timepieces, a sinister undercurrent threatens to undermine the very foundations of craftsmanship and authenticity.

Imagine this: for every genuine #Swiss watch ticking on a wrist, two counterfeits are being produced and this staggering reality sets the stage for our journey into the shadowy realm of counterfeit watches.

The luxury #watch market, valued at over $100 billion, has long been a symbol of prestige, artistry, and precision engineering. Brands like #Rolex, #Omega, and #Cartier have become synonymous with excellence, their timepieces coveted by collectors and enthusiasts worldwide.

However, lurking beneath this polished surface is a booming #counterfeit industry that threatens not just the bottom lines of watchmakers, but the very essence of what makes these timepieces special.

The Counterfeit Watch Epidemic
The numbers are staggering: an estimated 40 million counterfeit watches flood the market annually, generating a whopping $1 billion in illicit profits for counterfeiters and to put this into perspective, the entire Swiss watch industry produces around 20 million watches per year.

The economic impact of this epidemic extends far beyond lost sales for luxury brands. It erodes consumer trust, devalues the craftsmanship of genuine timepieces, and funnels money into criminal enterprises.

But what’s driving this explosive growth in counterfeit watches?

Two key factors have contributed to the surge in fake timepieces:

The rise of online marketplaces: The anonymity and global reach of e-commerce platforms have made it easier than ever for counterfeiters to sell their products to unsuspecting buyers worldwide. These digital bazaars often blur the lines between genuine and fake, making it challenging for consumers to discern authenticity.

Advancements in manufacturing techniques: Gone are the days when counterfeit watches were easily identifiable by their poor quality. Today’s counterfeiters have access to high-precision tools and materials, allowing them to produce increasingly convincing fakes. Some of these “superfakes” are so well-crafted that even experts can struggle to distinguish them from the real thing without close inspection.

As the counterfeit watch industry continues to evolve and expand, it poses an ever-growing threat to the integrity of the luxury watch market. In the following sections, we’ll delve deeper into how these fake timepieces are made, the risks they pose to consumers, and the innovative solutions emerging to combat this pervasive problem.

Inside the Shadows — How Counterfeit Watches Are Made
The world of counterfeit watch production is a testament to the dark side of innovation. As luxury watchmakers push the boundaries of craftsmanship and technology, counterfeiters are not far behind, constantly evolving their techniques to create more convincing fakes.

Evolution of Counterfeiting Techniques: In the early days, counterfeit watches were often crude imitations, easily identifiable by their poor quality and obvious flaws. However, the landscape has changed dramatically. Today’s counterfeiters employ sophisticated manufacturing processes that can produce watches that are alarmingly close to the real thing.

The Rise of “Superfakes”: The most concerning development in recent years has been the emergence of “superfakes” — counterfeit watches of such high quality that they can fool even experienced collectors. These watches often use materials that closely mimic those used in genuine timepieces, and their movements may even be based on legitimate Swiss designs.

Manufacturing Hubs and Distribution Networks: While many counterfeit watches originate in China, the industry has global reach. Sophisticated networks handle everything from production to distribution, often operating across multiple countries to evade law enforcement. Some counterfeiters have even been known to establish fake “authorized dealerships” to lend an air of legitimacy to their operations.

The process of creating a high-quality counterfeit watch typically involves:

Reverse engineering genuine watches to replicate their design and features
Sourcing materials that closely resemble those used in authentic timepieces
Using advanced machinery, often counterfeited versions of the equipment used by legitimate manufacturers
Assembling the watches with a level of precision that can rival that of genuine luxury timepieces
Creating convincing packaging and documentation to complete the illusion of authenticity
This level of sophistication makes it increasingly difficult for the average consumer to distinguish between real and fake watches, especially when shopping online or through unauthorized dealers. As we’ll explore in the next section, even the smallest details can make a big difference in determining a watch’s authenticity.

The Anatomy of a Fake
Understanding the differences between authentic and counterfeit watches is crucial for any discerning buyer. While modern counterfeits can be incredibly sophisticated, there are still telltale signs that can help identify a fake.

Weight: Genuine luxury watches often have a substantial feel due to the high-quality materials used. Counterfeits may feel lighter.

Movement: The smooth sweep of a genuine automatic movement is hard to replicate perfectly in cheaper counterfeits.

Engraving: Authentic watches typically have crisp, clear engravings. Fakes might have blurry or shallow markings.

Finishing: The level of detail in genuine watches, from polished surfaces to perfectly aligned dials, is often lacking in counterfeits.

Materials: High-end materials like sapphire crystal and precious metals are often substituted with cheaper alternatives in fakes.

Fighting Back — The Authentication Revolution
In the battle against counterfeit watches, TrustWatch emerges as a powerful ally for collectors, retailers, and casual buyers alike. This innovative system leverages advanced AI technology to provide quick, accurate, and reliable authentication of luxury timepieces.

The latest frontier in watch authentication leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies offer several advantages:

Speed: AI can analyze a watch in seconds, compared to hours for manual inspection

Accuracy: Machine learning algorithms can detect minute details that might escape human notice

Consistency: AI eliminates the variability of human judgment

Scalability: Can handle large volumes of authentication requests

Broad Coverage of Luxury Watch Brands: From Rolex to Patek Philippe, TrustWatch’s database encompasses a wide range of luxury watch brands.

Conclusion
In the end, a genuine luxury watch is more than just a timepiece — it’s a work of art, a piece of history, and a testament to human ingenuity.

By choosing authenticity, you’re not just making a purchase; you’re making a statement about value, quality, and respect for true craftsmanship. In a world of increasing uncertainty, let your wrist bear a symbol of genuine excellence and timeless authenticity.

Take the first step towards securing your passion for luxury watches today, get the TrustWatch system now and join a community of discerning collectors who prioritize authenticity and expertise.

With TrustWatch, you’ll have the power of AI-driven authentication at your fingertips, ensuring that every watch in your collection is genuinely what it claims to be.

Don’t let the fear of counterfeits hold you back — embrace the future of watch authentication and elevate your collecting experience.

Hoken Tech — How to participate in the ZEOS airdrop
Hoken Tech — How to participate in the ZEOS airdrop
Welcome to #HokenTech .

In the #crypto and #blockchain world, various projects use the #airdrop system, which is a distribution of project #tokens, following different instructions that once completed by the user, will result in obtaining new tokens of the project.

In this guide, we will see how to participate in the new airdrop related to the #ZEOS project, a project that allows you to obtain the benefits of #privacy, combined with the power of blockchain and its versatility, and we will see how to obtain the new tokens linked to this project.

https://youtu.be/X9y4tcIg8dg —


What is ZEOS?
First of all, let’s start with the ZEOS project, born several years ago on another project called PEOS, which planned to use the Monero protocol, but within a smart contract. This project was abandoned due to its difficulty, and the idea was later continued by other developers, but this time using the ZCash protocol.

And that’s how ZEOS was born, a project that leverages ZCash’s privacy protocol, all within a dedicated smart contract, and it’s as if it were an “emulator” of the ZCash blockchain that allows not only private transfers but also more interesting projects such as those related to decentralized finance (DeFi).

The new ZEOS airdrop
This is not the first time an airdrop of ZEOS tokens has been done, as the first was done to PEOS token holders, and with these tokens, it was possible to test the related protocol in demo and verify the power of this protocol.

In fact, these tokens act as “gas” for the protocol itself, where it’s possible to convert your tokens into this token and then use it within the protocol, for example, if I need to transfer $100, I can convert them to ZEOS, transfer them, and then convert them back to another token.

How to participate in the new airdrop?
To participate in the new airdrop, which we remind you can be done until the end of August 2024, you will need to have ZEOS tokens and transfer them to the smart contract that will burn the related tokens and mark the amount. In a second phase, it will be opened to insert the blockchain address to which the new tokens will be sent.

First of all, you will need to enable the old token in your wallet, for example Anchor, by going to token management and entering the relevant information as shown below:





Hoken Tech — ZEOS track token
Once we have entered the token information, we will see it among our available tokens, and at this point we will have to transfer the tokens to the related smart contract, and it will be enough to make a simple transaction from our account to that of the smart contract:



Hoken Tech — ZEOS transfer
In case we lack resources, we can pay a fee of a few cents to process the related transaction:


Hoken Tech — Transaction fee
Once we have sent the tokens, the smart contract will burn them and here we can see the data related to our account and how many tokens we have burned, where we will also see a column dedicated to the address, which as mentioned earlier, will be used at a later time when all the details related to the new token will be revealed, such as the destination blockchain and the ratio of old tokens to new ones.

Conclusions
The ZEOS project has evolved over time and the various prototypes released have excited the community, and now it is in the final stages of a journey that has lasted years and that this year will lead to the birth of a revolutionary project that technically could be brought to various blockchains.

For all those who want to learn more about this project and interface with the development team, here you can find the relevant links:

Hoken Tech — 5 Business Plan Myths Debunked — The Truth About Effective Planning
Hoken Tech — 5 Business Plan Myths Debunked — The Truth About Effective Planning
Welcome to #HokenTech .

In the world of #entrepreneurship, few tools are as fundamental as the #businessplan, yet, despite its importance, numerous myths and misconceptions surround the process of creating one and these myths can deter aspiring #entrepreneurs from crafting the #roadmap they need for success or lead them astray in their #planning efforts.

In this article, we’ll debunk five common business plan myths, revealing the truth about effective planning. We’ll also introduce you to the Startup Business Model Generator, an innovative tool designed to simplify and streamline the business planning process, making it accessible and valuable for entrepreneurs at all stages.

https://youtu.be/P9Yf1Ozos4g —


Myth 1: “Business plans are only for startups seeking funding”
Many believe that business plans are solely for new ventures looking to secure investment, but this couldn’t be further from the truth.

While it’s true that a well-crafted business plan is crucial for attracting investors, its value extends far beyond fundraising, and established businesses use plans for strategic direction, market expansion, and performance tracking.

A business plan is a versatile tool that:

Clarifies your business model and value proposition

Sets clear goals and strategies for achieving them

Identifies potential challenges and opportunities

Aligns team members around a common vision

The Startup Business Model Generator recognizes this versatility, because it offers customizable templates and guidance for businesses at all stages, from fledgling startups to established enterprises looking to pivot or expand, by using this tool, you’re not just creating a document for investors — you’re crafting a comprehensive strategy for business success.

Myth 2: “A business plan needs to be long and detailed to be effective”
The idea that longer equals better when it comes to business plans is a persistent myth, but in reality, the most effective business plans are often concise, focused, and to the point.

Investors, partners, and even you as the business owner don’t have time to wade through hundreds of pages, because what’s crucial is that your plan clearly communicates your business model, market opportunity, competitive advantage, and financial projections.

Key elements of an effective, concise plan include:

A compelling executive summary

Clear description of products or services

Well-defined target market

Realistic financial projections

Specific, actionable strategies

The Startup Business Model Generator excels at helping you create lean, mean business plans, where it guides you through the essential components, ensuring you include all necessary information without unnecessary fluff, and the result is a focused, impactful plan that respects your reader’s time while effectively communicating your business vision.

Myth 3: “Once you’ve written a business plan, you’re done”
A common misconception is that a business plan is a one-and-done document, in reality, an effective business plan is a living document that evolves with your business.

Markets change, new competitors emerge, and your business will grow and adapt, so your plan should reflect these changes, and regular reviews and updates ensure your plan remains a relevant, useful tool for guiding your business decisions.

Benefits of regularly updating your plan include:

Staying aligned with current market conditions

Tracking progress against goals

Identifying new opportunities or threats

Maintaining relevance for potential investors or partners

The Startup Business Model Generator makes ongoing planning a breeze, with its user-friendly interface and updatable sections, you can easily revise your plan as your business evolves.

Myth 4: “Financial projections in business plans are just guesswork”
Many entrepreneurs shy away from financial projections, believing they’re nothing more than wild guesses, however, while it’s true that you can’t predict the future with 100% accuracy, well-researched financial projections are far from mere guesswork.

Effective financial projections are based on:

Thorough market research

Realistic assumptions about costs and revenues

Historical data (for existing businesses)

Industry benchmarks and trends

These projections serve as a financial roadmap, helping you understand your business’s potential profitability, cash flow needs, and break-even point.

Myth 5: “You need to be a business expert to write a good plan”
Many aspiring entrepreneurs are intimidated by the idea of writing a business plan, believing it requires extensive business knowledge or an MBA, but this myth often prevents great ideas from ever making it to paper.

The truth is, while business expertise can be helpful, it’s not a prerequisite for creating a solid business plan, and what’s most important is:

A clear understanding of your business idea

Willingness to research your market and industry

Ability to articulate your vision and goals

Openness to learning and seeking advice when needed

The Startup Business Model Generator is designed to level the playing field, making expert-level business planning accessible to everyone, it provides step-by-step guidance, explains business concepts in plain language, and offers templates and examples to help you craft each section of your plan.

Conclusion
By debunking these myths, we hope to encourage more entrepreneurs to embrace the business planning process, because a well-structured business plan is not just a document for investors; it’s a powerful tool for clarifying your vision, setting goals, and charting a course for success.

The Startup Business Model Generator addresses each of these myths head-on, and it provides a flexible, user-friendly platform for creating and updating your business plan, regardless of your business type or level of expertise.

By simplifying the process and providing expert guidance, it empowers entrepreneurs to create plans that are not only investor-ready but also valuable for ongoing business management.
