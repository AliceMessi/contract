            What does it meas the fee (copertura spese) mentioned on point 6 of the contract? the cost is only linked to the actual cost of creating the NFT which is €12+VAT, to be paid only after one year and only if the NFT has not been sold.
            
            How do you quantify our "doing the work"? Is it by checking for link hits or by the number of social shares/posts? We provide a tracking link and QR code tied to the NFT link, which is personalized for each artist, so using that link we can actually track (only browser, country, city and operating system) everyone who clicks on that link.

            During the year, do we also have to guarantee our presence at any video calls regarding the progress of the NFT or as a presentation of the artist and the work in collaboration with the Michele Cea foundation? Virtual presence is not mandatory, but a more in-depth analysis will be done when the NFTs are sold.

            Is it possible to choose another work or will the one from the competition be used? The work is at the discretion of the artist, it does not necessarily have to be from the competition, although it is advisable as they will be catalogued in the collection of that competition (in fact for other works, artists usually rely on us to create a dedicated collection for the artist).

            How long will it be possible to exhibit the NFT work with this project? Il vantaggio degli NFT, è che una volta creata l'opera, questa rimarrà in vetrina per sempre, anche se venisse venduto o ceduto il relativo NFT, infatti grazie alla tracciabilità in blockchain, si possono seguire tutti i passaggi dalla creazione fino al possessore attuale.

            Will we be able to proceed independently in this field for other exhibitions of digital works? the works digitized in NFT will be carried out by our startup (in this specific case the number of NFTs is 1 per artist), where we will effectively manage it forever by our team that will follow all the technical updates that naturally occur on the blockchain; then usually the artists rely on us to create the single artist page (i.e. the showcase), and also the collection, and in that case it follows the standard path (€12+VAT for a single NFT) and includes:
creating the artist/project page, example https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/eos-mainnet/quadrigossip
creating the collection, example https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/schema/eos-mainnet/quadrigossip/scapicchifra
press release both ITA and ENG on the partnership with the artist, example https://medium.com/@hokentechitalia/juan-tardivo-sceglie-hoken-tech-ed-eos-per-la-sua-prima-collezione-nft-93da87777fb9
press release relating to the project, example https://medium.com/@hokentechitalia/la-collezione-ufficiale-nft-di-juan-tardivo-e93588baba7e
interview with the artist or with me or with the administrator Antonella, example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhThurNAAcI&list=PLbwtnTly-f3HLPhf7vSeejExN1_--Y-5c

            regarding the monetization issue, what advantages do NFTs offer? Can you find collectors interested in purchasing them more easily, for example? NFTs, being certificates that mathematically attest to the existence of the work, its origin, the artist and other information, allow them to be monetized directly, that is, it is the user who buys from the artist (the artist creates the work or whoever creates it, and immediately the work is accessible to everyone and can be viewed and bought by anyone in the world).

Another advantage is linked to its nature as a digital asset, acquiring various properties linked to the blockchain, for example:

- it can be exchanged with other NFTs
- it can be integrated into other media (for example NFT video games, in this case we have created several blockchain video games in which the player wins exclusive NFTs)
- contain unlockable content (for example an NFT of a book, can have the manuscript of the book as unlockable content)
- contain other crypto (for example in a competitive context, the winners are rewarded with exclusive NFTs that contain the cash prize)
- they survive over time, unlike traditional works of art, these NFTs that represent the works, will remain viewable and consultable forever
- historical archive, linked to the concept of before, thanks to NFTs you can have historical certainty (we are talking about orders of hundreds of years) on the works of an artist, identifying in an objective and mathematical way the original works and belonging to that artist
- renting the NFT, thanks to a particular smart contract, it is possible to rent your NFT to third parties in exchange for a fee
- obtain financing, by putting the relative NFT as a countervalue/collateral, the owner can obtain a loan based on the value of the NFT (like a pledge style)
- use it in corporate environments, for example our startup, also has an NFT as its share capital, demonstrating legal and economic value in this area
- be connected to physical goods, thanks to particular procedures (such as our tag), it is possible to associate the digital asset with the physical work, providing additional security
- be fused, there are particular smart contracts, which allow one or more NFTs to be merged, and from their fusion a new NFT is "born", a concept that has been and is used in some video games
- represent rights of various kinds, for example there are NFTs that do not represent a work of art, but a share of a company or a property, a sector that takes the name of Real World Asset (RWA), and in the case of properties, these are rented, and then the owners of the NFTs receive a share of the rent

            About a year and a half ago, I opened my own account on Metamask and at the moment there are €16 in Etherum. But then I didn't continue the path because I didn't have anyone to follow me and include me in a project and I had other priorities. I also published one of my works in NFT on the Foundation app, what I need to do? As for the NFT or NFTs you created, there are no problems, but they are incompatible with the EOS blockchain, and therefore to do things properly, you would have to "destroy" them and recreate them on EOS so as to have a harmony of the works and a coherence also with the main showcase, and I can also explain this to you calmly when we meet.

            Do I have to create a jiosign account to create OTP and therefore read the contract? Yes, it is used to have the mathematical security of the signature, so as not to create problems in the future.

            Price of the digital work only (separating it from the physical?) Right? Yes, the price, in dollars, of the digital work.

            If after a year the work is not sold, what happens? In economic terms? The artist then finds it on his account and has to liquidate it? Or did I misunderstand? The work continues to remain in the collection, you only have to pay €12+IVA, but it will then be managed by the artist, that's all.

            So, should the title of the work being considered be specified in the contract? It is not necessary to specify it also because it is one per artist and once the data has been acquired, it cannot be modified, so there is no risk of confusing subsequent works.
